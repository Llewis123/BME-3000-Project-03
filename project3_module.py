ANS Evaluation module
By Bila Bogre & Lincoln Lewis
@Llewis123 (github) & @B11LA (github)

This module provides novel functions for analyzing and filtering nervous system activity
This was originally designed and used to:
1. Filter ECG data
2. Automatically detect heartbeat times
3. Calculate HRV
4. Find HRV power in LF and HF frequency bands
5. Compare LF/HF ratios during periods of relaxation and stress

This module consists of x functions.
The first ,load data, can be used to load data of any units (firstly designed for volts)
of the following file types: .csv, .txt, .npz
If needed, the function can load data that is in the frequency domain, or time domain.
It can also plot it given an optional.

FOR CHANGELOG: See README.md file attached to module.

IMPORTANT: 
If you are using numpy, scipy, pandas or matplotlib with your project: you only need to import this module.
